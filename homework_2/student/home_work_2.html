                    <p class="text2">Saitama's character on the upper surface can be best summed up as "average". At
                        first glance, nothing about him strikes anyone he meets or causes them to note anything
                        remarkable about him. Before becoming a hero, he was an average salaryman and did not seem
                        interested in anything initially.though becoming a hero has always been a dream of
                        Saitama's. Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society, just like Hammerhead
                        and even commenting that he could have become just like them depending on the path he took.Due
                        to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person. Even
                        the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes
                        through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him
                        with a challenge. The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed
                        existential crisis, and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled
                        considerably. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and "unimpressive"
                        appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his
                        opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before
                        obliterating them with a single punch.Saitama's indifference doesn't rest solely on his hero
                        work either. In daily life, he is often seen lounging around, playing video games, reading
                        manga, or going out for strolls. His taste in food is rather plain, and he often frequents food
                        stalls rather than going to restaurants or cooking at home. As his primary interest, hero work
                        has become unfulfilling, and he pays little attention to anything else. A running gag about
                        Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgot
                        Speed-o'-Sound Sonic's name, or when he could not remember who Tanktop Tiger was.
                        Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their
                        chagrin. Saitama does not care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says
                        that they need a hobby;the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything
                        about his lack of hair. He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero
                        name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama.Beneath
                        the surface, Saitama is much more complex than his appearance and attitude suggest. While he
                        scored low on the written portion of the hero exam, he is, by no means, unintelligent. Saitama
                        is very observant, insightful, and has high tactical awareness.</p>
                    <p class="text3">This is seen in how he could
                        easily discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him. He
                        could pick up several hints about Sonic's persona upon their first meeting. When two tank
                        top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after the meteor event, he remarked that there were
                        irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discern Fubuki's forced offer
                        of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than
                        how it is currently run. Saitama has shown remorse to his enemies before, particularly those
                        who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this
                        is Boros, the self-claimed "Dominator of the Universe", with whom Saitama sympathized due to
                        suffering from similar circumstances, though, in the end, even Boros still could not draw out
                        Saitama's full power.</p>
