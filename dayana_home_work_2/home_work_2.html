                        Man.
                    </strong>
                    He is currently the most powerful being to exist in the series. Saitama faces a self-imposed
                    existential
                    crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from battle.

                    <p>
                        Saitama's character on the upper surface can be best summed up as "average".
                        At first glance, nothing about him strikes anyone he meets or causes them to note anything
                        remarkable about him. Before becoming a hero, he was an average salaryman and did not seem
                        interested in anything initially, though becoming a hero has always been a dream of
                        Saitama's.
                        Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society, just like Hammerhead and even
                        commenting that he could have become just like them depending on the path he took.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Due to his great power and being virtually indestructible, Saitama is an indifferent person.
                        Even
                        the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously,
                        goes
                        through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him
                        with a
                        challenge. The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed
                        existential
                        crisis, and he claims that his ability to feel any emotions has dulled considerably.
                        The
                        combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and "unimpressive" appearance often causes
                        his
                        battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about
                        their
                        motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single
                        punch.
                        Saitama is the titular One-Punch Man and the strongest character in the series. So far, no
                        enemy has
                        been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single
                        earnest
                        punch from him. A few enemies have survived punches from him, such as any human he has
                        struck (whom
                        he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against
                        so as to
                        give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His strength is so great that it
                        vastly
                        eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such as
                        mechanical beings or the mutated warriors from the House of Evolution. Since no enemies have
                        posed
                        any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher
                        than it
                        currently appears. The only opponent (so far) who has actually made him put visible effort
                        into
                        defeating was Garou, whose powers and abilities were enhanced by "God", and that's mostly
                        due to the
                        former's ability to copy Saitama's strength so as to fight him as an equal. While his power
                        is only
                        limited to heightened human traits (he cannot fly or fire energy blasts), his superhuman
                        abilities
                        are more than enough to compensate for the lack of variety in his powers.
